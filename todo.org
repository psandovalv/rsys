* Separation of data alignment with prediction algorithm
We should be able to quickly try out any algorithm without changing
the way we loop over the data etc.

Not sure how to easily do that. I wonder if R supports something like generators?

* Performance metrics for algorithms should be separated too.


* Write some code to generate data sets.
We should use quantmod to d/l yahoo data and have functions to create
the necessary datasets.

* Some algorithms to support
** Stepwise regression
** Lasso/Ridge
** svms
** knn
** randomForests
